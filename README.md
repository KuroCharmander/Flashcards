# Flashcards
Simple flashcard program that reads from csv files containing two columns (front and back of the card) using the pandas module. Cards that the user has learned will be removed from the card pile.

To change the csv to create flashcards, place the csv into the `data` folder and change the file directory through the `ORIGINAL_FILE` variable.

To run this without a Python environment, please go to https://repl.it/@KuroCharmander/Flashcards#.replit
